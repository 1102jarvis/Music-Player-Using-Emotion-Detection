# Music Player Using Emotion Detection

1. **Emotion recognition model:** CNN was used to achieve real-time emotion recognition from facial expressions.

3. **OpenCV Integration:** Camera operations were integrated with OpenCV, so that facial expressions could be analyzed from video input.

4. **Spotify Integration:** Using the Spotipy library, the music player was integrated with Spotify.

5. **Dynamic Song Selection:** A music player was designed which selects songs according to the user's identified emotional state.

6. **Emotional Categories:** Songs were divided into emotional states such as neutrality, sadness and happiness for tailor-made play lists.

7. **Technology Stack:** Keras For emotion detection, OpenCV, CNN for computer vision tasks spotipy for integrating with spotify

9. **Challenges and Solutions:** Overcame problems arising from inadequate datasets and poor model performance to secure robust detection of emotions and selection of songs.

10. **Future Enhancements:** Looking forward to future enhancements, adding emotion categories and fine-tuning the CNN model for better accuracy with a wider emotional spectrum.
